// VARIABLES: It is a storage box to store the data. Storage box's name is variable's name.

// Declaration
var a;
let b;
// But we can't only declare const, we have to assign the value(initialize) while declaring it.

// Declaration + Initialization
var a1 = 10;
let b1 = 20;
const pi = 3.14;
// Here is a catch, we can't reclare let and const.
// We can't update values of const.

// Demerits of var:
// 1. It add in window.
// 2. It is Function scoped.  -> Doesn't obey scope.
// 3. Redeclaration is possible.
